 * The Employee table holds all employees including their managers.
 * Every employee has an Id, and there is also a column for the manager Id.

 * +----+-------+--------+-----------+
 * | Id | Name  | Salary | ManagerId |
 * +----+-------+--------+-----------+
 * | 1  | Joe   | 70000  | 3         |
 * | 2  | Henry | 80000  | 4         |

 * | 4  | Max   | 90000  | NULL      |

 * Given the Employee table, write a SQL query that finds out employees
 * who earn more than their managers. For the above table, Joe is the
