/*
 * Given an unsorted array return whether an increasing subsequence

 *
 * Formally the function should:
 * Return true if there exists i, j, k 
 * such that arr[i] < arr[j] < arr[k] given 0 ≤ i < j < k ≤ n-1 else return false.
 * Your algorithm should run in O(n) time complexity and O(1) space complexity.
 *
 * Examples:
 * Given [1, 2, 3, 4, 5],
 * return true.
 *
 * Given [5, 4, 3, 2, 1],
 * return false.
