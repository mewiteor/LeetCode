 * Given two strings s and t, determine if they are isomorphic.
 *
 * Two strings are isomorphic if the characters in s can be replaced to get t.
 *
 * All occurrences of a character must be replaced with another
 * character while preserving the order of characters. No two characters
 * may map to the same character but a character may map to itself.
 *
 * For example,
 * Given "egg", "add", return true.
 *
 * Given "foo", "bar", return false.
 *
 * Given "paper", "title", return true.
 *
 * Note:
 * You may assume both s and t have the same length.
