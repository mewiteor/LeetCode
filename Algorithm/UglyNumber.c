 * Write a program to check whether a given number is an ugly number.
 *
 * Ugly numbers are positive numbers whose prime factors only include 2, 3, 5.
 * For example, 6, 8 are ugly while 14 is not ugly since it includes another prime factor 7.
 *
 * Note that 1 is typically treated as an ugly number.
